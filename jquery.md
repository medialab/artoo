<h2 id="why">Why jQuery?</h2>

It would be an understatement to say that jQuery is useless when it comes to DOM parsing and AJAX queries. This is indeed a nice and widely used library and anyone who has tried to scrape data from HTML with jQuery may have a lot of regrets when returning to XPath&#42;.

So, in order to make your scraping jobs an agreable moment, **artoo.js** injects jQuery within the page you are browsing.

But he does it carefully, ensuring that the injection of foreign code won't trouble the execution of the page you are scraping.

---

<h2 id="logic">Logic of the injection</h2>

The logic followed by the jQuery injection is the following:

> 1. If jQuery is present on the page in a correct version (superior to 2 by default), nothing is done.
<br><br>
> 2. If jQuery is not present and if `$` is not used by some other library, a suitable version of jQuery is injected.
<br><br>
> 3. Finally, if jQuery is present in a wrong version or if `$` is used by another library, jQuery will be injected but won't override the page's `$`. jQuery is then be available through `artoo.$`.

---

<h2 id="settings">jQuery settings</h2>

If you find it exhausting to use `artoo.$` in pages where **artoo** thinks he should not override another `$` variable and if you know for sure that reassigning it won't cause trouble, you are obviously free to do so.

```js
var $ = artoo.$;
```

You can also force jQuery to override the present `$` variable in the library's [settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/settings/#jquery).

Finally, if you prefer another jQuery version, you can also configure it in the same [settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/settings/#jquery).

---

<h2 id="simulate">jQuery simulate</h2>

In order to be able to trigger complex DOM events as well as a human would, **artoo** encapsulates the `jquery.simulate` [plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate).

It is commonly used to perform functionnal testing and ensure that interfaces are working correctly. But scrapers know it can be useful otherwise...

---

<h2 id="scrape">jQuery scrape</h2>

Every **artoo.js**' [scraping]({{Â site.baseurl }}/scrape) methods also comes packed as a jQuery plugin.

```js
artoo.scrape('.class', params);
// equals
$('.class').scrape(params);
```

---

<h2 id="dollar">$ in artoo's functions</h2>

Knowing that you may not be able to easily access jQuery through the global `$`, **artoo.js** gives access to his internal jQuery instance in some of his methods callbacks. This is the case for the `artoo.scrape` method.

*Example*

```js
// The callbacks take a first argument being a reference to artoo.$
artoo.scrape('ul > li', function($) {
  return $(this).attr('data-name');
});
```
